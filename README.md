# WeatherDashboard
06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description 

This single page website uses the openweathermap.org API's to provide weather based on user input. The user is able to enter search criteria in the format "city,st" (city comma 2 letter state) and will get the current weather along with the 5 day forecast. Cities are stored in local storage for the user's past searches from most recent to oldest. The page defaults to Hololulu as a fun starting value so the page is not blank. The user can enter a new city or click on a city in their history and see teh current information.

The page is responsive and shows all sections vertically once the screen width is less than 700px.

## Installation

The site is a single page html document with css, javascript and images so installation is straightforward: (1) push code to Github (2) Navigate to live link and make sure the site displays correctly. It does require an API key to opeweather which is currently stored inappropriately in javascript.

I worked with Chris Martinez & Kat Poulos (TA) who helped with the logic for clearing out elements prior to rebuilding them which was a critical need.
