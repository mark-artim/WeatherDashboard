## Description 

This code quiz asks a series of questions. The user attempts to answer the code-related questions within the time limit of 60 seconds. Incorrect answers reduce the user's remaining time by 15 seconds. The user's final score is the time remaining. The quicker they answer correctly, the higher their score. Once they have answered all the questions if there is any time remaining they are prompted to enter their initials which will be stored in local storage in a "leaderboard" that presents a sorted list of users and thier scores with the highest scores at the top. The user can choose to take teh quiz again and is allowed to clear the local storage if they confirm they wish to do so. The time decrement for wrong answers must be the total time in seconds divided by the number of questions so if they simply click the worng answer 4 times fast they cannot score positive points. Be carefult to make sure to reflect the time remaining in all cases such as if they get the last question wrong teh time must be decremented and displayed on screen prior to stopping the quiz.
